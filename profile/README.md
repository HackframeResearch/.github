## XLR8 Lab
We, at XLR8 Lab, are an ambitious startup and a research organization working on the next-generation of ultra-low power energy-efficient computing systems through circuit design, machine learning, integration of advanced memory systems and sophisticated microarchitectures to push the boundaries of technological innovation.

Our focus is on high reliability and energy-efficient technology to develop innovative solutions for the ever-growing demands of modern computing. By combining expertise in multiple fields across the computing abstraction layers, the group creates groundbreaking advancements in high-performance, low-power digital design that drive the future of computing and artificial intelligence applications.

Our current flagship projects include:
- **Hackframe**: A powerful design, simulate, execute - all in one - framework that offers developers a simple and efficient way to design, simulate, and execute custom logic workflows as a service. Its intuitive interface and pre-built components make it accessible to developers of all skill levels, while its robust features and hardware deployment options make it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.

- **Tracy**: A design space exploration tool for neural engine microarchitecture research. It employs deep reinforcement learning and is trained using a reward function, which is based on the performance and energy consumption of different microarchitecture designs. Tracy is designed to predict the performance and energy consumption of a given microarchitecture design based on user-defined input parameters for a given custom logic.
 
Join us as we engineer a more efficient future through state-of-the-art electronic systems design and integration.
